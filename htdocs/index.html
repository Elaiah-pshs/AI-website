                        <p>

Artificial Intelligence is one of the most promising emerging technologies in
computer science and programming. The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined
by John Mcarthy in one of his lectures way back during 1956. Back then, Mcarthy
could only dream of such a technology. Today, Mcarthy's dream of artificial
intelligence has become reality. Better yet, not only did we manage to create
artificial intelligence (to some extent), but we also managed to integrate it
to almost every aspect of our lives. However, despite its popularity and wide
usage, many people do not truly understand what Artificial Intelligence is, how
it works, and why we decided to create it in the first place. That is why this
website was made.

                        <h3>The Goal</h3>
                        <p>

This website aims to:
<ul>
    <li>
        Explain what artificial intelligence is to
        people with little to no knowledge on
        programming,
    </li>
    <li>
        Explain why AI was created in the first place,
    </li>
    <li>
        Expound on how an AI is created, and
    </li>
    <li>
        Clear up some misconceptions about artificial
        intelligence
    </li>
</ul>

                        </p>

                        <h3>The Strategy</h3>
                        <p>

First, you will be introduced to concepts related to artificial intelligence,
such as intelligence, agents, environments, and the turing test. Then, you will
learn about what AI really is, along with its advantages and uses.

                        </p>
                        <p>

After that, you will be walked through the process of developing a basic AI,
which involves machine learning algorithms, data preparation, and logic
programming

                        </p>
                        <p>

Finally, you will be shown all the applications of AI, such as gaming, natural
language processing, and computer vision. The underlying code for these
applications will also be presented

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            
Pro tip: If there is something you do not understand, try hovering your mouse
over it. There might be a hidden tooltip.
