            Artificial Intelligence is one of the most promising
            emerging technologies in computer science and programming.
            However, despite its popularity, many people do not truly
            understand what Artificial Intelligence is, how it works,
            and why we decided to create it in the first place. The
            goal of this website is to explain artificial intelligence
            to users with no knowledge of programming and clear up some
            misconceptions about artificial intelligence. There will be
            page to explain complex topics in digestible bits, a page
            to teach users how a simple AI is made, and a page to state
            the different uses of AI that may affect the users.

                            The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined by John
                            Mcarthy in one of his lectures way back during 1956.
                            Back then, Mcarthy could only dream of such a technology.
                            Today, Mcarthy's dream of artificial intelligence has
                            become reality. Better yet, not only did we manage to
                            create artificial intelligence (to some extent), but we
                            also managed to integrate it to almost every aspect of our
                            lives. However, despite its popularity and wide usage, many
                            people do not truly understand what Artificial Intelligence
